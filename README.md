# Telco-Corp-Customer-Churn-Analysis
The data set describes customers of a telco corp, by several demographical variables (gender, partner, seniorcitizen, dependents), account information (tenure, contract, payment, billing) and some services that customer may have purchsed (internet, streaming, support, backup...)

All those variables are descriptive, and the target column is churn column, which is boolean column that specifies whether a customer left or not.

In this project we analyze the different attributes and relate any to the churn attribute, to conclude the main reasons customers left and enable the telco company to predict which customersmay leave in order to try avoiding it
